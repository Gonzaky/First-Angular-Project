</footer>

<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE TO FOOTER:
In this case i have the footer inside the "app.comp.html/app.js"
 and im using a conditional inside "footer.comp.ts" using a function with ngIf to show only if condition is true
 BUT i could also make use of the <router-outlet> in the app.js , which means i could place <app-footer> to the
 "tasks.component.html" which would make it only show when that component loads,
  if I did that it means I would also need to place the <app-footer> tag in every single component that
  i wanted it to show.
